# Lab 1 - Intro to Rust & core library

1. Security from the language point of view
2. Introduction to Rust

## Laboratory Task
At the end of the laboratory you will have to fill in a laboratory report. You can download the [template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/znfzrtygmbzr) or create an [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account and clone the project.

Please explain each workpoint in the laboratory in the submitted report.

<!--# Old kids on the block

- C was developed __50 years__ ago
- is ok when only geeks use computers

Why now?
- C was the only language used for OS
- C allows you to do anything
- few people write code in C, most of them use C++, C#, Java and others
  - unsless you write drivers or embedded software
  - C++ is another funny story, what about [Go](https://golang.org/)?

We have new tools available
- now we have languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [D](https://dlang.org/)

# New kids on the block

This is what we would most probably use

- Math - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Low level - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Services (web servers ...) - [Go](https://golang.org/)
- Applications
  - enterprise - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  - web applications - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - mobile - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

- Rocket Science (we assume you work for NASA) - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- Electrical Engineering - [LabView](https://www.ni.com/ro-ro/shop/labview.html)
- Scripting - [Deno](https://deno.land/)

# Quick view upon security issues

We will analyse the following security issues using simple C programs:
  - Use after free
  - Heap overflow
  - Stack overflow
  - `gets`
  - Memory leaks
  - Out of scope
  - `printf`

---
## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="900" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>) 

### Use after free

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: gerbil-snail-tamarin
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *array=(int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*100);
  array[1] = 120;
  free (array);
  printf ("%d\n", array[1]);
  return 0;
}
  
```

Please explain what happens in the laboratory report.

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Heap overflow

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: phil-mouse-bear
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // fill memory
    int *data = (int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*700);
    for (int i=0; i< 700; i++)
    {
        data[i] = 0xBEEFBEEF;
    }
    free (data);
    
    // alocate
	int *array=(int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*100);
	for (int i=0; i< 100; i++) {
	    array[i] = 0;
	}
	int value=array[500];
	free (array);
	
	printf ("value %d\n", value);
	return 0;
}

```

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Stack overflow

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: cassowary-finch-moose
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int stack_array[100];
	stack_array[1] = 0;
	printf ("%d\n", stack_array[100]);
	return 0;
}

```

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## `gets`

Even the compiler notices that this is wrong.

```c
// program: pony-porcupine-pony
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	char s[10];
	gets(s);
	return 0;
}

```

Why is this a problem? Please explain in the laboratory report.

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Memory leaks

```c
// program: parrot-quail-monkey
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void *p;

int main() {
	p = malloc(7);
	p = NULL; // The memory is leaked here.
	return 0;
}

```
How can you solve this security issue?

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Out of scope

```c
// program:quetzal-ape-buffalo
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int *p = 0;

int main() {
	{
		int x = 0;
		p = &x;
	}
	*p = 5;
	return 0;
}

```
Please explain what the problem is in the laboratory report.
.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## `printf`

```c
// program: kangaroo-kangaroo-dragonfly
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 10

int main() {
	char s[MAX_SIZE]; 
    fgets (s, MAX_SIZE-1, stdin);
    printf (s);
}

```
This is a tricky one. Can you identify the problem?

# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a programming language designed with security in mind. This means that the compiler will not allow risky operations and that you have to follow secure patterns.

Further on, we will take a look into the basics of Rust:
1. Simple Rust
2. Types
3. Expressions
4. Control Flow
5. Functions
.right[![rust](../images/rust.svg)]

---

# Simple Rust 

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `println!` is a macro, not a function, it replaces code.
- The `main` function does not return a value (almost true).

.card[.large[.center[![Hello Rust](../images/sep_hello.png)]]]

---
## `print!` & `println!`
- Use `print!` and `println!` to print stuff out.
- Use `{}` for general string interpolation, and `{:?}` for debug printing.
    - Some types can only be printed with `{:?}`, like arrays and `Vec`.

```rust
print!("{}, {}, {}", "foo", 3, true);
// => foo, 3, true
println!("{:?}, {:?}", "foo", [1, 2, 3]);
// => "foo", [1, 2, 3]
```


## `format!` 
- Uses `println!`-style string interpolation to create formatted `String`s.

```rust
let fmted = format!("{}, {:x}, {:?}", 12, 155, [1,2,3]);
// fmted == "12, 9b, [1,2,3]"
```

---

## Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Alter the code below so it prints your name.

```rust
// let name = ...
println! ("Hello SdE, I am {} and Rust is awesome");
```

---

## `panic!(msg)`
- Exits current task with given message.
- Don't do this lightly! It is better to handle and report errors explicitly.

```rust
if x < 0 {
    panic!("Oh noes!");
}
```

## `assert!` & `assert_eq!`

- `assert!(condition)` panics if `condition` is `false`.
- `assert_eq!(left, right)` panics if `left != right`.
- `debug_assert!(condition)` and `debug_assert_eq!(left, right)` work in debug build, but omitted in release build.

```rust
let actual = 1 + 2;
assert!(actual == 3);
assert_eq!(3, actual);
```

<!--
## `unreachable!()`

- Used to indicate that some code should not be reached.
- `panic!`s when reached.
- Can be useful to track down unexpected bugs (e.g. optimization bugs).

```rust
if false {
    unreachable!();
}
```


## `unimplemented!()`

- Shorthand for `panic!("not yet implemented")`.

```rust
fn sum(x: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    // TODO
    unimplemented!();
}
```
-->
---

## `dbg!()`

- A macro for quick and dirty debugging with which you can inspect the value of a given expression.
- Was added in Rust 1.32.

```rust
let a = 2;
let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4
assert_eq!(b, 5);
```

---

## Variable Bindings ###
- Variables are bound with `let`:
```rust
let x = 17;
```

- Bindings are implicitly-typed: the compiler infers based on context.
- The compiler can't always determine the type of a variable, so sometimes you
  have to add type annotations.
```rust
let x: i16 = 17;
```

- Variables are inherently immutable:
```rust
let x = 5;
x += 1; // error: re-assignment of immutable variable x
let mut y = 5;
y += 1; // OK!
```

---
## Variable Bindings ###
- Bindings may be shadowed:
```rust
let x = 17;
let y = 53;
let x = "Shadowed!";
// x is not mutable, but we're able to re-bind it
```

- The shadowed binding for `x` above lasts until it goes out of scope.
- Above, we've effectively lost the first binding, since both `x`s are in the same scope.

- Patterns may also be used to declare variables:
```rust
let (a, b) = ("foo", 12);
let [c, d] = [1, 2];
```

---
## Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Print the a + b expression

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
// print debug information for the a + b expression
```
b. Print the city and the temperature in celsius degrees.
```rust
let city = Bucharest;
let fahrenheit = 70;
// print the following message: There are ... celsius degrees in Bucharest.
```

Don't forget there are some macros that can help you.

---
class: split-70
# Primitive Types 

.column[
- `unit`: () (similar with `void` from C)
- `bool`: `true` and `false`
- `char`: `'c'` or `'ðŸ˜º'` (`char`s are Unicode code-points, i.e. 4 bytes long!)

- Numerics: specify the signedness and size.
    - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `isize`
    - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `usize`
    - `f32`, `f64`
    - `isize` & `usize` are the size of pointers (and therefore have
        machine-dependent size)
    - Literals are spelled like `10i8`, `10u16`, `10.0f32`, `10usize`.
    - Type inference for non-specific literals default to `i32` or `f64`:
      - e.g. `10` defaults to `i32`, `10.0` defaults to `f64`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Data Types](../images/sep_datatypes.png)]]]
]

---
## References 

- Reference *types* are written with an `&`: `&i32`.
- References can be taken with `&` (similar to C/C++).
- References can be _dereferenced_ with `*` (similar C/C++).
- References are guaranteed to be valid.
    - Validity is enforced through compile-time checks!
- These are *not* the same as pointers!
- Reference lifetimes are pretty complex, and we will explore them later.

```rust
let x = 12;
let ref_x = &x;
println!("{}", *ref_x); // 12
```

---
## Arrays
- Arrays are generically of type `[T; N]`.
    - N is a compile-time _constant_. Arrays cannot be resized.
    - Array access is bounds-checked at runtime.
- Arrays are indexed with `[]` like most other languages:
    - `arr[3]` gives you the 4th element of `arr`

```rust
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]; // (array of 3 elements)
let arr2 = [2; 32];   // (array of 32 `2`s)
```

.card[.small[.center[![Array Define](../images/sep_array_define.png) ![Array Access](../images/sep_array_access.png)]]]

---
## Slices
- Generically, a slice of an array of type `[T;N]` is of type `&[T]`.
- A slice is a "view" into an array (or heap allocated data) and works by reference.
- Slices are not created directly, but are borrowed from other variables.
- A slice can be mutable `&mut [T]` or immutable `&[T]`.

```rust
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let val = arr[0];               // val = 0
let total_slice = &arr;         // Slice all of `arr`
let total_slice = &arr[..];     // Same, but more explicit
let partial_slice = &arr[2..5]; // [2, 3, 4]
```

---
## Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Print the first 3 elements of the array

```rust
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print!();
```
How many `print!` calls did you make? Please explain in the laboratory report.

---
## Strings
- There are two types of Rust strings: `String` and `&str`.
- `String` is a heap-allocated, growable vector of characters.
- `&str` is a type&sup1; that's used to slice into `String`s.
- String literals like `"foo"` are of type `&str`.
- Strings are guaranteed to be encoded using UTF-8.

```rust
let s: &str = "galaxy";
let s2: String = "Ð³Ð°Ð»Ð°ÐºÑ‚Ð¸ÐºÐ°".to_string();
let s3: String = String::from("éŠ€æ¼¢");
let s4: &str = &s3;
```

```rust
let s1 = "foobar";
// You can slice strings:
let s2 = &s1[1..3];
// But you can't index with []
// you can use `s1.chars().nth(1).unwrap()` instead
let s3 = s1[1] // does not work!
```

&sup1;`str` is an unsized type, which doesn't have a compile-time known size,
and therefore cannot exist by itself.

---
## Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Print the first word in the string.

```rust
let s = "Hello Rust";
//TODO
print!();
```
b. Print the first string character.
```rust
let s = "Hello Rust";
//TODO
print!();
```
---
## Tuples 
- Tuples are fixed-size, ordered, heterogeneous lists.
- Index into tuples with `foo.0`, `foo.1`, etc.
- Can be destructured (eg. in `let` bindings).

```rust
let foo: (i32, char, f64) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (x, y, z) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (a, b, c) = foo; // a = 72, b = 'H', c = 5.1
```

---
# Casting 

- Cast between types with `as`:

```rust
let x: i32 = 100;
let y: u32 = x as u32;
```

- Naturally, you can only cast between types that are safe to cast between.
    - No casting `[i16; 4]` to `char`! (This is called a "non-scalar" cast).
    - There are unsafe mechanisms to overcome this, if you know what you're doing.


---
# Expressions

- (Almost!) everything is an expression: something which returns a value.
    - Exception: variable bindings are not expressions.
- An expression can also return the "nothing" type.
- The "nothing" type is called "unit", which is written `()`.
    - The _type_ `()` has only one value: `()`.
    - `()` is the default return type.
- You can discard an expression's value by appending a semicolon. Now it returns `()`.
    - Hence, if a function ends in a semicolon, it returns `()`.

```rust
fn foo() -> i32 { 5 }
fn bar() -> () { () }
fn baz() -> () { 5; }
fn qux()       { 5; }
```
Complete the laboratory report stating what each of the expressions above returns.

---
# Control Flow

Let's see how basic control flow blocks work.
- `if` and `match` 
- `while` and `loop`
- `for` iteration

---
## If Statements

```rust
let x = 10;

if x > 0 {
    println! ("positive");
} else if x == 0 {
    println! ("zero");
} else {
    println! ("negative");
}
```
- No parentheses necessary.
- Entire if statement evaluates to one expression, so every branch must end with
  an expression of the same type.
    - In this example, the return value is unit `()`:

---
## Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum between a and b  without changing its mutability.

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 100;
let max = ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber, **almost everything is an expression** that returns a value.

---

## `match` 
- `switch` on steroids.

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    1 => println!("one fish"),  // <- comma required
    2 => {
        println!("two fish");
        println!("two fish");
    },  // <- comma optional when using braces
    // we can match several patterns in one arm
    3 | 4 => println!("three or four, dunno"),
    _ => println!("no fish for you"), // "otherwise" case
}
```

- `match` takes an expression (`x`) and branches on a list of `value => expression` statements.
- The entire match evaluates to one expression.
    - Similar to `if`, all branches must evaluate to the same type.
- `_` is commonly used as a catch-all (similar to Haskell, OCaml)

---

## Workpoint 7 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Write a `match` that prints whether a number is odd or even.

```rust
let n = 10;

let t = match n {
  ... =>
  ... =>
}

println! ("{} is {}", n, t);
```

.card[.small[.center[![Match](../images/sep_match.png)]]]

---
## `match` pattern
```rust
let x = 3;
let y = -3;
let q = 10;

let s = match (x, y) {
    (1, 1) => "one".to_string(),
    (2, j) => format!("two, {}", j),
    (_, 3) => "three".to_string(),
    (i, j) if i > 5 && j < 0 => "On guard!".to_string(),
    // NB: note that we do not test x == 10 here!
    (q, k) => format!("???: {} {}", q, k),
};
println!("{}", s);
```

- The matched expression can be any expression, including tuples and function calls.
    - Matches can bind variables. `_` is a throw-away variable name.
- You _must_ write an exhaustive match in order to compile.
- Use `if`-guards to constrain a match to certain conditions.
- Patterns can get very complex.

---

## Workpoint 8 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Calculate the factorial (n!) of a number. Panic if computation is not possible.

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> u32 {
  match n {
    _ => unimplemented!()
  }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("-10!: {} 0!: {} 10: {}", factorial(-10), factorial(0), factorial(10));
}
```

You will have to perform a typecast.

---

## `while` 
- Loops come in three flavors: `while`, `loop`, and `for`.
    - `break` and `continue` exist just like in most languages.

- `while` works just like you'd expect:

```rust
let mut x = 0;
while x < 100 {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

While loops are not expressions.

---
## `loop` 
- `loop` is equivalent to `while true`, a common pattern.
    - Plus, the compiler can make optimizations knowing that it's infinite.

```rust
let mut x = 0;
loop {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

Loops are not expressions.

---
## `for` iteration
- `for` is the most different from most C-like languages.
     - `for` loops use an _iterator expression_:
     - `n..m` creates an iterator from n to m (exclusive).
     - Some data structures can be used as iterators, like arrays and `Vec`s.

```rust
// Loops from 0 to 9.
for x in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", x);
}

let xs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// Loop through elements in a slice of `xs`.
for x in &xs {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

For loops are not expressions.

---
## Workpoint 9 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum number in the array. Do not use any function.

```rust
let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
let max = v[0];
// ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber array slices are iterators that return references to array elements.

---
class: split-50
# Functions 

```rust
fn foo(x: T, y: U, z: V) -> T {
    // ...
}
```
.column[
- `foo` is a function that takes three parameters:
    - `x` of type `T`
    - `y` of type `U`
    - `z` of type `V`
- `foo` returns a `T`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Function](../images/sep_function.png)]]]
]

<br>

- Must explicitly define argument and return types.
    - The compiler is actually smart enough to figure this out for you, but
      Rust's designers decided it was better practice to force explicit function
      typing.

---
## Functions Return

- The final expression in a function is its return value.
    - Use `return` for _early_ returns from a function.

```rust
fn square(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n
}

fn squareish(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n < 5 { return n; }
    n * n
}

fn square_bad(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n;
}
```

- The last one won't even compile!
  - Why? 

---

## Workpoint 10 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum of a and b

  ```rust
  let a = 10;
  let b = 100;
  let max = maximum (a, b);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

b.  Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum element of `v`.

  ```rust
  let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
  let max = maximum (&v);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

  Hint: You have to send a refernce of `v` to the function.


<!--
# Modules

1. `mod` statement

  ```rust
  mod security {
      fn secure () {
        // ...
      }
  }

  fn main () {
      security::secure ();
  }
  ```

  Why does it not compile?

2.  `mod` source

  ```rust
  mod security; // <- loads module from security.rs

  fn main () {
      security::secure ();
  }
  ```



# Enum

- An enum, or "sum type", is a way to express some data that may be one of several things.
- Similar to the union type in C
- Much more powerful than in Java, C, C++, C#...
- Each enum variant can have optional payloads:
    - no data (unit variant)
    - named data (struct variant)
    - unnamed ordered data (tuple variant)

```rust
enum Resultish {
    Ok,
    Warning { code: i32, message: String },
    Err(String)
}
```

.card[.small[.center[![Enum](../images/sep_enum.png)]]]

class: split-70
# Enum `match`-ing

- Enum variants are namespaced by their enum type: `Resultish::Ok`.
    - You can import all variants with `use Resultish::*`.
- Enums, much as you'd expect, can be matched on like any other data type.

.column[
```rust
match make_request() {

# `Option`

- Rust has no NULL type
- a variable of a type has to store a value of that actual type
- a reference has to exist and point to a valid memory

Use `Option` enum

.column[
```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T)
  None,
}
```

T is any valid type
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Option](../images/sep_option.png)]]]
]



## `Option` example

Rust automatically imports  `Option::*`

```rust
fn integer_division (a:isize, b: isize) -> Option<isize> {
  if b == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(a / b)
  }
}

fn main () {
  let x = 120;
  let y = 7;
  match integer_division (x, y) {
    Some(d) => println! ("{}:{} = {}", x, y, d),
    None => println! ("division by 0")
  };
}
```


# Workpoint 8 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Write the factorial (n!) function without panicing if the computation is not possible. Use one single `println!`.

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> Option<u32> {
  match n {
    _ => unimplemented!()
  }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("-10!: {} 0!: {} 10!: {}", factorial(-10), factorial(0), factorial(10));
  // prints -10!: not possible, 0!: 0, 10!: 3628800
}
```

Hint: take a look at `if let`.



## Structs

- A struct declaration:
    - Fields are declared with `name: type`.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

- By convention, structs have `CamelCase` names, and their fields have `snake_case` names.
- Structs may be instantiated with fields assigned in braces.

```rust
let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
```


## Structs

- Struct fields may be accessed with dot notation.
- Structs may not be partially-initialized.
    - You must assign all fields upon creation, or declare an uninitialized
      struct that you initialize later.

```rust
let mut p = Point { x: 19, y: 8 };
p.x += 1;
p.y -= 1;
```



# Structures

- Structs do not have field-level mutability.
- Mutability is a property of the **variable binding**, not the type.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    mut y: i32, // Illegal!
}
```


## Structures privacy

- Structs are namespaced with their module name.
    - The fully qualified name of `Point` is `foo::Point`.
- Struct fields are private by default.
    - They may be made public with the `pub` keyword.
- Private fields may only be accessed from within the module where the struct is
    declared.

```rust
mod foo {
    pub struct Point {
        pub x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let b = foo::Point { x: 12, y: 12 };
}
```

.bottom_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] Fix the example!


## Structures

```rust
mod foo {
    pub struct Point {
        pub x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }

    // Creates and returns a new point
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}
```

- `new` is inside the same module as `Point`, so accessing private fields is
  allowed.
- `new` is not a keywork in rust

---
## Structures `match`ing

- Destructure structs with `match` statements.

```rust
pub struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

match p {
    Point { x, y } => println!("({}, {})", x, y)
}
```


## Structures `match`ing

- Some other tricks for struct `match`es:

```rust
match p {
    Point { y: y1, x: x1 } => println!("({}, {})", x1, y1)
}

match p {
    Point { y, .. } => println!("{}", y)
}
```
- Fields do not need to be in order.
- List fields inside braces to bind struct members to those variable names.
    - Use `struct_field: new_var_binding` to change the variable it's bound to.
- Omit fields: use `..` to ignore all unnamed fields.


## Structures Update Syntax

- A struct initializer can contain `.. s` to copy some or all fields from `s`.
- Any fields you don't specify in the initializer get copied over from the target struct.
- The struct used must be of the same type as the target struct.
    - No copying same-type fields from different-type structs!

```rust
struct Foo { a: i32, b: i32, c: i32, d: i32, e: i32 }

let mut x = Foo { a: 1, b: 1, c: 2, d: 2, e: 3 };
let x2 = Foo { e: 4, .. x };

// Useful to update multiple fields of the same struct:
x = Foo { a: 2, b: 2, e: 2, .. x };
```


## Tuple Structs

- Variant on structs that has a name, but no named fields.
- Have numbered field accessors, like tuples (e.g. `x.0`, `x.1`, etc).
- Can also `match` these.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

let mut c = Color(0, 255, 255);
c.0 = 255;
match c {
    Color(r, g, b) => println!("({}, {}, {})", r, g, b)
}
```


## Workpoint 9 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Print the structure elements without using match.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

let mut c = Color(0, 255, 255);
println!("({}, {}, {})", ..., ..., ...)
```


## Tuple Structs

- Helpful if you want to create a new type that's not just an alias.
    - This is often referred to as the "newtype" pattern.
- These two types are structurally identical, but not equatable.

```rust
// Not equatable
struct Meters(i32);
struct Yards(i32);

// May be compared using `==`, added with `+`, etc.
type MetersAlias = i32;
type YardsAlias  = i32;
```


## Unit Structs (Zero-Sized Types)

- Structs can be declared to have zero size.
    - This struct has no fields!
- We can still instantiate it.
- It can be used as a "marker" type on other data structures.
    - Useful to indicate, e.g., the type of data a container is storing.

```rust
struct Unit;

let u = Unit;
```


# Methods

```rust
impl Point {
    pub fn distance(&self, other: Point) -> f32 {
        let (dx, dy) = (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y);
        ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    p.distance();
}
```

- Methods can be implemented for structs in an `impl` block.
- Like fields, methods may be accessed via dot notation.
- Can be made public with `pub`.
    - `impl` blocks themselves don't need to be made `pub`.


## Methods

- The first argument to a method, named `self`, determines what kind of ownership the method
  requires.
- `&self`: the method *borrows* the value.
    - Use this unless you need a different ownership model.
- `&mut self`: the method *mutably borrows* the value.
    - The function needs to modify the struct it's called on.
- `self`: the method takes ownership.
    - The function consumes the value and may return something else.


## Methods

```rust
impl Point {
    fn distance(&self, other: Point) -> f32 {
        let (dx, dy) = (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y);
        ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
    }

    fn translate(&mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        self.x += x;
        self.y += y;
    }

    fn mirror_y(self) -> Point {
        Point { x: -self.x, y: self.y }
    }
}
```

- `distance` needs to access but not modify fields.
- `translate` modifies the struct fields.
- `mirror_y` returns an entirely new struct, consuming the old one.


## Associated Functions

```rust
impl Point {
    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point::new(1, 2);
}
```

- Associated function: like a method, but does not take `self`.
    - This is called with namespacing syntax: `Point::new()`.
        - Not `Point.new()`.
    - Like a "static" method in Java.
- A constructor-like function is usually named `new`.
    - No inherent notion of constructors, no automatic construction.



# Workpoint 10 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Write the implementation for the Professor struct

```rust
struct Person {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

impl Person {
  // new function
  // setters for properties
}

fn main () {
  let p = Person::new ("The".to_string(), String::from("Name"), 9);
  p.set_firstname ("New".to_string());
  println! ("{} {} is now {}", p.firstname, p.lastname, p.age);
}
```

There are lots of adaptations to be done for this.

# Traits


- Similar to interfaces in Java
- Methods that types have to implement

.column[
```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
  // add subjects
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

impl Person for Professor {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }

  fn get_job (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }
}
```
]

# Workpoint 11 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Implement `Person` for `Professor` and `Student`

```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

struct Student {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

fn main () {
  // make a student
  let p = Professor::new (String::from("John"), String::from("Doe"), 20);
  let s = Student::new ("Johnny".to_string(), "Doe".to_string(), 50);
  // make a professor
  println! ("{:?}", p);
  println! ("{:?}", s);

  println! ("{} is a {}", p.get_name (), p.get_job());
  println! ("{} is a {}", s.get_name (), s.get_job());
}
```

Hint: to copy a string, getv a `str` and use the `to_string` method.



# Workpoint 12 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the source code work:

```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);
    let n3 = Complex::new (2, -3);
    let n4 = Complex::new (3, 0);
    let n5 = Complex::new (0, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n3); // prints 2-3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n4); // prints 3
    println! ("The number is {}", n5); // prints 3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n1); // prints 0
    println! ("The number is {}", n1+n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1*n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1/n2);
    println! ("The numbers {} and {} are {}", n1, n2, if n1==n2 { "equal"} else {"not equal"});
}
```
  - Hint: use the Display, Add, Sub, Mul, Div and PartialEq traits. 
  - Read the compiler hints carefully.
