# Lab 1 - Intro to Rust & core library

1. Security from the language point of view
2. Introduction to Rust

## Laboratory Task
At the end of the laboratory you will have to fill in a laboratory report. You can download the [template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/znfzrtygmbzr) or create an [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account and clone the project.

Please explain each workpoint in the laboratory in the submitted report.

<!--# Old kids on the block

- C was developed __50 years__ ago
- is ok when only geeks use computers

Why now?
- C was the only language used for OS
- C allows you to do anything
- few people write code in C, most of them use C++, C#, Java and others
  - unsless you write drivers or embedded software
  - C++ is another funny story, what about [Go](https://golang.org/)?

We have new tools available
- now we have languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [D](https://dlang.org/)

# New kids on the block

This is what we would most probably use

- Math - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Low level - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Services (web servers ...) - [Go](https://golang.org/)
- Applications
  - enterprise - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  - web applications - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - mobile - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

- Rocket Science (we assume you work for NASA) - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- Electrical Engineering - [LabView](https://www.ni.com/ro-ro/shop/labview.html)
- Scripting - [Deno](https://deno.land/)

# Quick view upon security issues

We will analyse the following security issues using simple C programs:
  - Use after free
  - Heap overflow
  - Stack overflow
  - `gets`
  - Memory leaks
  - Out of scope
  - `printf`

---
## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="900" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>) 

### Use after free

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: gerbil-snail-tamarin
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *array=(int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*100);
  array[1] = 120;
  free (array);
  printf ("%d\n", array[1]);
  return 0;
}
  
```

Please explain what happens in the laboratory report.

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Heap overflow

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: phil-mouse-bear
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // fill memory
    int *data = (int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*700);
    for (int i=0; i< 700; i++)
    {
        data[i] = 0xBEEFBEEF;
    }
    free (data);
    
    // alocate
	int *array=(int*)malloc (sizeof(int)*100);
	for (int i=0; i< 100; i++) {
	    array[i] = 0;
	}
	int value=array[500];
	free (array);
	
	printf ("value %d\n", value);
	return 0;
}

```

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Stack overflow

What will this sequence print?

```c
// program: cassowary-finch-moose
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int stack_array[100];
	stack_array[1] = 0;
	printf ("%d\n", stack_array[100]);
	return 0;
}

```

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## `gets`

Even the compiler notices that this is wrong.

```c
// program: pony-porcupine-pony
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	char s[10];
	gets(s);
	return 0;
}

```

Why is this a problem? Please explain in the laboratory report.

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Memory leaks

```c
// program: parrot-quail-monkey
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void *p;

int main() {
	p = malloc(7);
	p = NULL; // The memory is leaked here.
	return 0;
}

```
How can you solve this security issue?

.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## Out of scope

```c
// program:quetzal-ape-buffalo
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int *p = 0;

int main() {
	{
		int x = 0;
		p = &x;
	}
	*p = 5;
	return 0;
}

```
Please explain what the problem is in the laboratory report.
.right_img[.right[![security](../images/security.png)]]

---

## `printf`

```c
// program: kangaroo-kangaroo-dragonfly
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 10

int main() {
	char s[MAX_SIZE]; 
    fgets (s, MAX_SIZE-1, stdin);
    printf (s);
}

```
This is a tricky one. Can you identify the problem?

# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a programming language designed with security in mind. This means that the compiler will not allow risky operations and that you have to follow secure patterns.

Further on, we will take a look into the basics of Rust:
1. Simple Rust
2. Types
3. Expressions
4. Control Flow
5. Functions
.right[![rust](../images/rust.svg)]

---

# Simple Rust 

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `println!` is a macro, not a function, it replaces code.
- The `main` function does not return a value (almost true).

.card[.large[.center[![Hello Rust](../images/sep_hello.png)]]]

---
## `print!` & `println!`
- Use `print!` and `println!` to print stuff out.
- Use `{}` for general string interpolation, and `{:?}` for debug printing.
    - Some types can only be printed with `{:?}`, like arrays and `Vec`.

```rust
print!("{}, {}, {}", "foo", 3, true);
// => foo, 3, true
println!("{:?}, {:?}", "foo", [1, 2, 3]);
// => "foo", [1, 2, 3]
```


## `format!` 
- Uses `println!`-style string interpolation to create formatted `String`s.

```rust
let fmted = format!("{}, {:x}, {:?}", 12, 155, [1,2,3]);
// fmted == "12, 9b, [1,2,3]"
```

---

## Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Alter the code below so it prints your name.

```rust
// let name = ...
println! ("Hello SdE, I am {} and Rust is awesome");
```

---

## `panic!(msg)`
- Exits current task with given message.
- Don't do this lightly! It is better to handle and report errors explicitly.

```rust
if x < 0 {
    panic!("Oh noes!");
}
```

## `assert!` & `assert_eq!`

- `assert!(condition)` panics if `condition` is `false`.
- `assert_eq!(left, right)` panics if `left != right`.
- `debug_assert!(condition)` and `debug_assert_eq!(left, right)` work in debug build, but omitted in release build.

```rust
let actual = 1 + 2;
assert!(actual == 3);
assert_eq!(3, actual);
```

<!--
## `unreachable!()`

- Used to indicate that some code should not be reached.
- `panic!`s when reached.
- Can be useful to track down unexpected bugs (e.g. optimization bugs).

```rust
if false {
    unreachable!();
}
```


## `unimplemented!()`

- Shorthand for `panic!("not yet implemented")`.

```rust
fn sum(x: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    // TODO
    unimplemented!();
}
```
-->
---

## `dbg!()`

- A macro for quick and dirty debugging with which you can inspect the value of a given expression.
- Was added in Rust 1.32.

```rust
let a = 2;
let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4
assert_eq!(b, 5);
```

---

## Variable Bindings ###
- Variables are bound with `let`:
```rust
let x = 17;
```

- Bindings are implicitly-typed: the compiler infers based on context.
- The compiler can't always determine the type of a variable, so sometimes you
  have to add type annotations.
```rust
let x: i16 = 17;
```

- Variables are inherently immutable:
```rust
let x = 5;
x += 1; // error: re-assignment of immutable variable x
let mut y = 5;
y += 1; // OK!
```

---
## Variable Bindings ###
- Bindings may be shadowed:
```rust
let x = 17;
let y = 53;
let x = "Shadowed!";
// x is not mutable, but we're able to re-bind it
```

- The shadowed binding for `x` above lasts until it goes out of scope.
- Above, we've effectively lost the first binding, since both `x`s are in the same scope.

- Patterns may also be used to declare variables:
```rust
let (a, b) = ("foo", 12);
let [c, d] = [1, 2];
```

---
## Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Print the a + b expression

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
// print debug information for the a + b expression
```
b. Print the city and the temperature in celsius degrees.
```rust
let city = Bucharest;
let fahrenheit = 70;
// print the following message: There are ... celsius degrees in Bucharest.
```

Don't forget there are some macros that can help you.

---
class: split-70
# Primitive Types 

.column[
- `unit`: () (similar with `void` from C)
- `bool`: `true` and `false`
- `char`: `'c'` or `'😺'` (`char`s are Unicode code-points, i.e. 4 bytes long!)

- Numerics: specify the signedness and size.
    - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `isize`
    - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `usize`
    - `f32`, `f64`
    - `isize` & `usize` are the size of pointers (and therefore have
        machine-dependent size)
    - Literals are spelled like `10i8`, `10u16`, `10.0f32`, `10usize`.
    - Type inference for non-specific literals default to `i32` or `f64`:
      - e.g. `10` defaults to `i32`, `10.0` defaults to `f64`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Data Types](../images/sep_datatypes.png)]]]
]

---
## References 

- Reference *types* are written with an `&`: `&i32`.
- References can be taken with `&` (similar to C/C++).
- References can be _dereferenced_ with `*` (similar C/C++).
- References are guaranteed to be valid.
    - Validity is enforced through compile-time checks!
- These are *not* the same as pointers!
- Reference lifetimes are pretty complex, and we will explore them later.

```rust
let x = 12;
let ref_x = &x;
println!("{}", *ref_x); // 12
```

---
## Arrays
- Arrays are generically of type `[T; N]`.
    - N is a compile-time _constant_. Arrays cannot be resized.
    - Array access is bounds-checked at runtime.
- Arrays are indexed with `[]` like most other languages:
    - `arr[3]` gives you the 4th element of `arr`

```rust
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]; // (array of 3 elements)
let arr2 = [2; 32];   // (array of 32 `2`s)
```

.card[.small[.center[![Array Define](../images/sep_array_define.png) ![Array Access](../images/sep_array_access.png)]]]

---
## Slices
- Generically, a slice of an array of type `[T;N]` is of type `&[T]`.
- A slice is a "view" into an array (or heap allocated data) and works by reference.
- Slices are not created directly, but are borrowed from other variables.
- A slice can be mutable `&mut [T]` or immutable `&[T]`.

```rust
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let val = arr[0];               // val = 0
let total_slice = &arr;         // Slice all of `arr`
let total_slice = &arr[..];     // Same, but more explicit
let partial_slice = &arr[2..5]; // [2, 3, 4]
```

---
## Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Print the first 3 elements of the array

```rust
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print!();
```
How many `print!` calls did you make? Please explain in the laboratory report.

---
## Strings
- There are two types of Rust strings: `String` and `&str`.
- `String` is a heap-allocated, growable vector of characters.
- `&str` is a type&sup1; that's used to slice into `String`s.
- String literals like `"foo"` are of type `&str`.
- Strings are guaranteed to be encoded using UTF-8.

```rust
let s: &str = "galaxy";
let s2: String = "галактика".to_string();
let s3: String = String::from("銀漢");
let s4: &str = &s3;
```

```rust
let s1 = "foobar";
// You can slice strings:
let s2 = &s1[1..3];
// But you can't index with []
// you can use `s1.chars().nth(1).unwrap()` instead
let s3 = s1[1] // does not work!
```

&sup1;`str` is an unsized type, which doesn't have a compile-time known size,
and therefore cannot exist by itself.

---
## Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Print the first word in the string.

```rust
let s = "Hello Rust";
//TODO
print!();
```
b. Print the first string character.
```rust
let s = "Hello Rust";
//TODO
print!();
```
---
## Tuples 
- Tuples are fixed-size, ordered, heterogeneous lists.
- Index into tuples with `foo.0`, `foo.1`, etc.
- Can be destructured (eg. in `let` bindings).

```rust
let foo: (i32, char, f64) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (x, y, z) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (a, b, c) = foo; // a = 72, b = 'H', c = 5.1
```

---
# Casting 

- Cast between types with `as`:

```rust
let x: i32 = 100;
let y: u32 = x as u32;
```

- Naturally, you can only cast between types that are safe to cast between.
    - No casting `[i16; 4]` to `char`! (This is called a "non-scalar" cast).
    - There are unsafe mechanisms to overcome this, if you know what you're doing.


---
# Expressions

- (Almost!) everything is an expression: something which returns a value.
    - Exception: variable bindings are not expressions.
- An expression can also return the "nothing" type.
- The "nothing" type is called "unit", which is written `()`.
    - The _type_ `()` has only one value: `()`.
    - `()` is the default return type.
- You can discard an expression's value by appending a semicolon. Now it returns `()`.
    - Hence, if a function ends in a semicolon, it returns `()`.

```rust
fn foo() -> i32 { 5 }
fn bar() -> () { () }
fn baz() -> () { 5; }
fn qux()       { 5; }
```
Complete the laboratory report stating what each of the expressions above returns.

---
# Control Flow

Let's see how basic control flow blocks work.
- `if` and `match` 
- `while` and `loop`
- `for` iteration

---
## If Statements

```rust
let x = 10;

if x > 0 {
    println! ("positive");
} else if x == 0 {
    println! ("zero");
} else {
    println! ("negative");
}
```
- No parentheses necessary.
- Entire if statement evaluates to one expression, so every branch must end with
  an expression of the same type.
    - In this example, the return value is unit `()`:

---
## Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum between a and b  without changing its mutability.

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 100;
let max = ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber, **almost everything is an expression** that returns a value.

---

## `match` 
- `switch` on steroids.

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    1 => println!("one fish"),  // <- comma required
    2 => {
        println!("two fish");
        println!("two fish");
    },  // <- comma optional when using braces
    // we can match several patterns in one arm
    3 | 4 => println!("three or four, dunno"),
    _ => println!("no fish for you"), // "otherwise" case
}
```

- `match` takes an expression (`x`) and branches on a list of `value => expression` statements.
- The entire match evaluates to one expression.
    - Similar to `if`, all branches must evaluate to the same type.
- `_` is commonly used as a catch-all (similar to Haskell, OCaml)

---

## Workpoint 7 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Write a `match` that prints whether a number is odd or even.

```rust
let n = 10;

let t = match n {
  ... =>
  ... =>
}

println! ("{} is {}", n, t);
```

.card[.small[.center[![Match](../images/sep_match.png)]]]

---
## `match` pattern
```rust
let x = 3;
let y = -3;
let q = 10;

let s = match (x, y) {
    (1, 1) => "one".to_string(),
    (2, j) => format!("two, {}", j),
    (_, 3) => "three".to_string(),
    (i, j) if i > 5 && j < 0 => "On guard!".to_string(),
    // NB: note that we do not test x == 10 here!
    (q, k) => format!("???: {} {}", q, k),
};
println!("{}", s);
```

- The matched expression can be any expression, including tuples and function calls.
    - Matches can bind variables. `_` is a throw-away variable name.
- You _must_ write an exhaustive match in order to compile.
- Use `if`-guards to constrain a match to certain conditions.
- Patterns can get very complex.

---

## Workpoint 8 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Calculate the factorial (n!) of a number. Panic if computation is not possible.

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> u32 {
  match n {
    _ => unimplemented!()
  }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("-10!: {} 0!: {} 10: {}", factorial(-10), factorial(0), factorial(10));
}
```

You will have to perform a typecast.

---

## `while` 
- Loops come in three flavors: `while`, `loop`, and `for`.
    - `break` and `continue` exist just like in most languages.

- `while` works just like you'd expect:

```rust
let mut x = 0;
while x < 100 {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

While loops are not expressions.

---
## `loop` 
- `loop` is equivalent to `while true`, a common pattern.
    - Plus, the compiler can make optimizations knowing that it's infinite.

```rust
let mut x = 0;
loop {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

Loops are not expressions.

---
## `for` iteration
- `for` is the most different from most C-like languages.
     - `for` loops use an _iterator expression_:
     - `n..m` creates an iterator from n to m (exclusive).
     - Some data structures can be used as iterators, like arrays and `Vec`s.

```rust
// Loops from 0 to 9.
for x in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", x);
}

let xs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// Loop through elements in a slice of `xs`.
for x in &xs {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

For loops are not expressions.

---
## Workpoint 9 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum number in the array. Do not use any function.

```rust
let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
let max = v[0];
// ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber array slices are iterators that return references to array elements.

---
class: split-50
# Functions 

```rust
fn foo(x: T, y: U, z: V) -> T {
    // ...
}
```
.column[
- `foo` is a function that takes three parameters:
    - `x` of type `T`
    - `y` of type `U`
    - `z` of type `V`
- `foo` returns a `T`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Function](../images/sep_function.png)]]]
]

<br>

- Must explicitly define argument and return types.
    - The compiler is actually smart enough to figure this out for you, but
      Rust's designers decided it was better practice to force explicit function
      typing.

---
## Functions Return

- The final expression in a function is its return value.
    - Use `return` for _early_ returns from a function.

```rust
fn square(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n
}

fn squareish(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n < 5 { return n; }
    n * n
}

fn square_bad(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n;
}
```

- The last one won't even compile!
  - Why? 

---

## Workpoint 10 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

a. Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum of a and b

  ```rust
  let a = 10;
  let b = 100;
  let max = maximum (a, b);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

b.  Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum element of `v`.

  ```rust
  let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
  let max = maximum (&v);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

  Hint: You have to send a refernce of `v` to the function.
